# Guiding Principles of REST

- 1. Client-Server

By separating the user interface concerns from the data storage concerns, we improve the portability of the user interface across multiple platforms and improve scalability by simplifying the server components.

通过将用户界面关注点与数据存储问题分离开来提高跨多个平台的用户界面的可移植性

通过简化服务器组件来提高可伸缩性。

client application and server application MUST be able to evolve separately without any dependency
on each other.

Client should `know only resource URIs` and that’s all.

- 2. Stateless

Each request from client to server must contain all of the information necessary to understand the request, and cannot take advantage of any stored context on the server. Session state is therefore kept entirely on the client.

每个从客户端到服务器的请求必须包含让服务器理解这个请求的所有必要信息，不可以利用存储在服务器的上下文信息

会话状态全都保存在客户端

Server will not store anything about latest HTTP request client made. It will treat each and every request as new. No session, no history.

- 3. Cacheable

Cache constraints require that the data within a response to a request be implicitly or explicitly labeled as cacheable or non-cacheable. If a response is cacheable, then a client cache is given the right to reuse that response data for later, equivalent requests.

缓存约束要求对请求的响应中的数据隐式或显式地标记为可缓存或不可缓存。如果响应是可缓存的，那么客户端缓存将被赋予重用该响应数据的权利，以供以后的等效请求使用。

In REST, `caching shall be applied on resources` when applicable and then these resources MUST declare themselves cacheable. 

- 4. Uniform interface

REST is defined by four interface constraints: 

- identification of resources; 资源标识
- manipulation of resources through representations; 通过资源的表示来操作资源
- self-descriptive messages; 自描述信息
- hypermedia as the engine of application state. 超媒体作为应用状态的引擎

- 5. Layered system

- 6. Code on demand (optional)

# Resource

Any information that can be named can be a `resource`

每个resource必须拥有唯一的URI

The state of resource at any particular timestamp is known as `resource representation`

resource representation 包括

- data 数据

- metadata 描述数据的元数据

- hypermedia link 超媒体链接，帮助客户端转换到下一个期望的状态

resource representations shall be self-descriptive （自描述的）

`resource methods` are used to perform the desired transition
